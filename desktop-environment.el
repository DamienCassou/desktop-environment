;;; Commentary:

;; This package helps you control your GNU/Linux desktop from Emacs.
;; With desktop-environment, you can control the brightness and volume
;; as well as take screenshots and lock your screen.  The package
;; depends on the availability of shell commands to do the hard work
;; for us.  These commands can be changed by customizing the
;; appropriate variables.

;; The global minor mode `desktop-environment-mode' binds standard
;; keys to provided commands: e.g., <XF86AudioRaiseVolume> to raise
;; the volume, <print> to take a screenshot, and <s-l> to lock the
;; screen.
