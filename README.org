** Summary

The package desktop-environment provides commands and a global minor
mode to control your GNU/Linux desktop from Emacs.

With desktop-environment, you can control the brightness and volume as
well as take screenshots and lock your screen.  The package depends on
the availability of shell commands to do the hard work for us.  These
commands can be changed by customizing the appropriate variables.

The global minor mode ~desktop-environment-mode~ binds standard keys
to provided commands: e.g., ~<XF86AudioRaiseVolume>~ to raise the
volume, ~<print>~ to take a screenshot, and ~<s-l>~ to lock the
screen.

** Installing

Add the following to your initialization file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lib/desktop-environment/")
  (require 'desktop-environment)
#+END_SRC

If you want all commands to be bound to keys, add this line after the
ones above:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (desktop-environment-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Usage

The following table summarizes the available commands and their
keybinding if ~desktop-environment-mode~ is enabled:

**** Using light instead of brightnessctl

You might prefer to use [[https://haikarainen.github.io/light/][light]] instead of [[https://github.com/Hummer12007/brightnessctl][brightnessctl]]. This can be
done by adding the following to your configuration file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq desktop-environment-brightness-get-command "light")
  (setq desktop-environment-brightness-set-command "light %s")
  (setq desktop-environment-brightness-get-regexp "^\\([0-9]+\\)")
  (setq desktop-environment-brightness-normal-increment "-A 10")
  (setq desktop-environment-brightness-normal-decrement "-U 10")
  (setq desktop-environment-brightness-small-increment "-A 5")
  (setq desktop-environment-brightness-small-decrement "-U 5")
#+end_src

**** EXWM Compatibility

The customizable variable ~desktop-environment-update-exwm-global-keys~ can be
used to control how key bindings should be handled when EXWM is loaded.

If set to ~:global~ (the default), the key bindings will be set via
`exwm-input-set-key`.  This ensures that these are global bindings which work
regardless of char-mode or line-mode.

When predominantly working with line mode, however, it may make sense to set it
to the value ~:prefix~ instead.  This way, EXWM knows to forward the bindings to
the minor mode map in line mode.  This way, when disabling
~desktop-environment-mode~, the bindings are deactivated again.

Set to ~nil~ to disable any kind of special behavior in the presence of EXWM.
